          I'm currently a student working towards my degree in Information
          Technology/Application Development at Oakland University. My interests
          include software design and development, machine learning, and User
          Experience/User Interface. Information Technology became my choice
          after experiencing first-hand the numerous benefits that it has
          brought to our world, like improved communication, increased
          productivity, enhanced decision-making, and greater access to
          information and knowledge. Application development became a passion
          for me once I realized that designing computer programs allowed me to
          use my creative and problem-solving skills.

          I am a cloud developer intern at Irdeto, a company that developed a
          keyless solution for fleet management systems using a secure,
          permission-based vehicle digital key solution that leverages Bluetooth
          Low Energy technology to enable proximity-based vehicle access using a
          smartphone. I have contributed to the design, development, debugging,
          testing, and deployment of the Keystone Cloud operations. Upon
          graduation, I hope to get a job as full-stack developer or UI/UX
          designer. To learn more about me, check out
